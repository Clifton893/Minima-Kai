### 👨‍💻 Professional
- Making great progress on Google's IT Support Professional certificate on Coursera. 
  - Almost done with the Networking course (the second of five courses), having just gone through DNS and DHCP.

### 🛠 Projects
- Finally put this website up! A lot of work, study, and play went into it!
- Starting up my homelab strategy. First up is building a new desktop, so I'm putting the shopping list together.

### 🏠 Personal
- I wish the weather was a bit cooler! Still, my health is great, and I really can't complain about anything at all right now. 🙏
