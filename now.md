### 👨‍💻 Professional
- Finished course 2 (Networking) of Google's IT Support Professional certificate on Coursera!
  - I'm looking forward to course 3, which is all about operating systems!

### 🛠 Projects
- Finally put this website up! A lot of work, study, and play went into it!
- Planning out my homelab. First up is building a new desktop, so I'm putting the shopping list together.

### 🏠 Personal
- I got my wish, and the weather is getting chilly! Staying grateful for everything, I have my health and can pay my bills. 🙏
