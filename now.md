### 👨‍💻 Professional
- Started up course 3 (Operating Systems) of Google's IT Support Professional certificate on Coursera. Excited!
- Kept my ear to the ground, and now that I've got breathing room, time to ramp up the job search.

### 🛠 Projects
- New blog post is up! I wrote a [case study on making this website]({% post_url /_posts/2020-12-03-case-study %}), so check it out!
- Slowly but surely getting the components to my new desktop workstation. I'm looking forward to getting the homelab set up!

### 🏠 Personal
- I got my wish, and the weather is getting chilly! Staying grateful for everything, I have my health and can pay my bills. 🙏
