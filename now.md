### 👨‍💻 Professional
- Making great progress on Google's IT Support Professional certificate on Coursera. 
  - Studying about 2 hours every morning before work; and 6-8 hours every day off.
  - Currently halfway through the Networking course, having just taken a deep look at the TCP/IP Model.

### 🛠 Projects
- This website has been a work-in-progress for a while, and I'm really happy with how it's come together!
- A little behind on codifying my notes into my study guide; but the spaced repetition helps a lot with reviewing content.

### 🏠 Personal
- I'm loving the (somewhat cooler) weather, finally hitting Austin. Coffee tastes better on those chilly mornings!
- Not a lot of time for movies or video games, with all the work and study. Mostly just the evening news.
