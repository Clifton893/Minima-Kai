title:  "This Website: A Case Study"
---
### What's the purpose of this site?
To establish a homepage for my brand and personality on the Internet, so that others can learn more about me.

### What's the story behind this site?
Though I had a presence on LinkedIn, Twitter, and Medium, I lacked a central hub for myself. While I loved the idea of using GitHub's [new profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) feature as a homepage, I didn't think it got the job done. I needed a website proper.

#### Why GitHub Pages?
- I needed the site to be free, since I was already broke even before the coronavirus ravaged the US economy. 
- I also wanted good responsiveness--in the literal sense so it performed great on mobile browsers, and in the figurative sense that it was fast.
- I also needed it to be secure and stable.

This led me to GitHub Pages, which satisfied all three criteria. Now: How to present the site?

### Why did I choose the Minima theme?
Browsing the official GitHub Pages themes, [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) was the first to catch my attention. I liked the simple, mobile-friendly layout. I did explore the [Cayman](https://github.com/pages-themes/cayman) and [Hacker](https://github.com/pages-themes/hacker) themes; but Minima's austerity was irresistible. It provided a professional-looking format, with room for a little personality in the typography and colors.

### Why did I pick this font?
Like I said, I wanted to inject a little character to this site, and typography is a huge part of a site's visual identity. For that, I chose [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) and [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) to replace Minima's base typography style.

#### IBM Plex Sans
As a lifelong Texan and decade-long Austinite, I loved the idea of honoring IBM by using this typeface. After all, IBM was a major influencer in Austin's evolution as a booming tech city. But I also loved the visual identity of **IBM Plex Sans**. It's easy on the eyes, and pleasant to read. It's also got style (check out the capital J!), and has a playful, industrial vibe to it. I love it!

I had considered [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif)... but that made my site look too much like Medium. ðŸ˜œ

#### IBM Plex Mono
The other good thing about the IBM Plex superfamily is `IBM Plex Mono`, which is ideal for code snippets. So, I replaced the default monospace font with it, as a gorgeous compliment to IBM Plex Sans in the body.

### Why did I pick these colors?
Green and pink are my brand colors:

- Green represents growth, nature, and calm.
- Pink symbolizes compassion, playfulness, and invitation.

Paired together, the colors suit my eccentric personality and zen attitude--and they look great! But, I had to use them in accordance with WCAG. 

So I rooted around, and settled on [Google Chrome Green](https://encycolorpedia.com/1aa260). Set to a bold weight, the color added a vibrant pop to the website. I complimented it with a [lovely hue of pink](https://encycolorpedia.com/ff90b6) I had set aside in my notes (because I do geeky things like that), setting it as the cursor highlight color.

### Takeaways
I learned a lot about web development over the course of this project. 

On the documentation side, this was my first time implementing a changelog. Version history and semantics were new subjects for me, and it was exciting to begin understanding them. My README-writing skills have improved too, I think.

My agile-based methodology improved, too. I relied more heavily on Trello in a kanban format, which really helped break the project down into bite-sized, accomplishable features.

On the development side, this project was where I really began using proper version control. I still relied on GitHub's GUI (rather than using git through the command line), but my understanding of branch structure really leveled up here. 

I also noticed my temperament and patience have come a long way. I used to get frustrated when bugs popped up, taking failure as a personal slight. With practice, study, and a little mellowing with age, I'm pleased that I've gotten way better at troubleshooting and solving problems.

**In summary:** I'm really happy with how things turned out! The site ended up as I had envisioned, and I'm a far stronger web developer for having produced it.
