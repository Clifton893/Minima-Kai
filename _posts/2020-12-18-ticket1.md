title:  Troubleshooting: Accessing Coursera's Graded External Tool for Windows
---

## Issue
In Coursera's Google IT Support Professional program, Qwiklabs's virtual labs are used as graded assessments. 

However, I couldn't connect to Qwiklabs's virtual machine for Windows labs, as the RDP connection always gave an error code of `0x204`.

## Solution
Thanks to Qwiklab's great customer support, I learned I could access the virtual machine through [Allmydesktops.com](https://www.allmydesktops.com).

## Steps
While logging in to the remote desktop through [A.M.D.](https://www.allmydesktops.com):

1. Click on "Sign Up Free" if you don't already have an account, or click on Log In.
2. Click on the "New Connection" button on the left side of the page.
3. Fill out the fields as follows:
    - Protocol: RDP
    - Connection Name: 'Windows Instance'
    - Hostname: Enter the external IP provided to you in the Qwiklabs instruction connection detail.
    - Port: Leave this blank.
    - Username: Enter username as 'student.'
    - Password: Enter the password which is provided in the connection detail.
    - Click "save."
4. Click the "Connect" button when you see the connection labeled "Windows Instance."
5. You should now have access to the Qwiklabs virtual machine.
