title:  "Welcome to my blog!"

I created this site to be my own personal space on the web, and as a way for me to continue learning as an IT student.

You see, I'm a bit of a nerd: I *love* research papers. Analysis, note-taking, and documentation are just plain fun for me. And they're my preferred way to learn about new subject matter.

I also want to hone my ability to take complex subjects, and explain them in easy-to-understand ways. This way, potential employers can peek into my thought process, assess my knowledge of technical concepts, and see how I communicate them in my own words.

Regardless of why you're here, welcome to my blog!
