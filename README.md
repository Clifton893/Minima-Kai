## Introduction 👋
- This repo for my personal blog, based on the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) Jekyll theme.
- This is placeholder content for this README file, and will be updated with a proper format and content.

## Release History 📝
See: [CHANGELOG.md](/CHANGELOG.md)

## Motivation 🤔
I love learning, I love technology, and I love solving problems. So I created this site to satisfy all three of those things!

1. My favorite way to learn something new is to write a research paper about it;
2. Coding this site was a great exercise in source control, web development, and project management;
3. Potential employers can see if I'm a good fit for their team, and gauge my IT understanding.

## Structure 🏛
This repo follows the Gitflow Workflow model, established by [Vincent Driessen](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/):
- `main` serving as the released, production-ready branch
- `develop` for a working branch for the next release
- `feature`, `release`, and `hotfix` as modular, supporting branches
