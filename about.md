### Howdy!

I'm Clifton, an IT student based in Austin, Texas.

Curious by nature, I have a big appetite for knowledge. From documentation to best practices, across technologies historic and cutting-edge, few things thrill me more than learning about technology. But one thing that *does* thrill me more is finding solutions to other peoples' problems. And I connected the dots, and realized that it was time to change careers into information technology.
