### Howdy!

I'm Clifton, an IT student based in Austin, Texas.

Curious by nature, I have a big appetite for knowledge. From documentation to best practices, across technologies historic and cutting-edge, few things thrill me more than learning about technology. But one thing that *does* thrill me more is finding solutions to other peoples' problems. And I connected the dots, and realized that it was time to change careers into information technology.

### How I got here

Growing up, I was a kid who preferred TechTV over MTV, and Ubuntu over Windows. I also taught myself Japanese as a teenager, and pursued international studies at Texas State University. I was a great student; unfortunately, college just got too expensive, and I had to drop out.

Instead, I took that Japanese knowledge and applied it at the culinary level. I moved to Austin, and apprenticed under chefs from Nagoya and Fukuoka to learn classic Japanese cuisine. I'd move on to supervising dinner banquets in the kitchens of the JW Marriott Austin; and become the executive chef at Tillery Kitchen & Bar.

But despite these accolades, I was burning out. Something was missing. I wasn't where I wanted to be in life--financially, physically, or emotionally. I needed a change, but I didn't know what to do.

### Then I found code

At first, it was just a hobby. Learning HTML, making "Hello World," that stuff. But I became obsessed. I woke up at 4:00am every day for nearly a year, to teach myself web development before going to work. 

And I realized that I'd acquired many soft skills in my career that directly transfer over to a career in IT:

- Customer service
- High-pressure scenarios
- Complex project management
- Documentation
- Collaborative problem-solving

So here I am, fleshing out my education to prepare for the CompTIA A+ certification, and a new, exciting career. ðŸ˜„
