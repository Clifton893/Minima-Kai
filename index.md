**My name's Clifton**, and I'm an information technology student pursuing Google's IT Support Professional certificate. [I also used to be a sushi chef!](/about.md)

I love learning, I love technology, and I love solving problems. So I created this site to satisfy all three of those things!
- My favorite way to learn something new is to write a research paper about it;
- Coding this site was a great exercise in source control, web development, and project management;
- Potential employers can verify my IT understanding.

Welcome to my blog!
