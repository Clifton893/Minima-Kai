**My name's Clifton**, and I'm an information technology student pursuing Google's IT Support Professional certificate. [I also used to be a sushi chef!](/about.md)

I love learning, I love technology, and I love solving problems. So I created this site to satisfy all three of those things!
- My favorite way to learn something new is to write a research paper about it;
- Coding this site was a great exercise in source control, web development, and project management;
- Potential employers can see if I'm a good fit for their team.

#### Wanna get in touch?
If you're visiting this site, there's a good chance you came via my resume or job application. So, you probably already have my contact info.

But if you didn't, you can reach me on LinkedIn or Twitter through the links in my site footer!
